# (deprecated) un-material-tab library

I don't have time to maintain this. I basically wrote this small library in a rush, without tests, while working on my own project as a beginner. As a result, there's a lot of things that aren't that great as well as the missing features. Don't really know if I would have some time to finish it completely.

I'd recommend you to use the official TabLayout from Google or another 3rd party library.

If someone wants to pick up where I left off, make a fork of this, notify me and I'll link to your repo here.

A customizable alternative of TabLayout from Support Design library which provides almost the same functionality.

## Currently working on
   - [x] `RoundTabLayout#onTabSelected` & `RoundTabLayout#onTabReselected` callbacks
   - [x]  reducing number of GPU view updates
   - [ ]  new tab animations

If you have any suggestions - feel free to open an issue.

## How to add? 
I. In your `build.gradle` file add the following dependency:
```
dependencies {
    compile 'com.ruslankishai:unmaterialtabs:0.1a'
}
```
II. Declare `RoundTabLayout` inside your `layout.xml` file:
```xml
<com.ruslankishai.unmaterialtab.tabs.RoundTabLayout
            android:id="@+id/round_tabs"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:background="@color/colorPrimary"
            app:accent="@color/colorAccent" />
```
III. Declare `RoundTabLayout` with `ViewPager` in your 'class.java':
```java
ViewPager viewPager = (ViewPager) findViewById(R.id.viewPager);

//set adapter to your ViewPager
viewPager.setAdapter(new TabPagerAdapter(getFragmentManager()));

RoundTabLayout tabLayout = (RoundTabLayout) findViewById(R.id.roundTabLayout);
tabLayout.setupWithViewPager(viewPager);
```
IV. Override you `getPageTitle` method in your ViewPager’s adapter to return tab title.
```java
@Override
public CharSequence getPageTitle(int position) {  
     switch (position) {
          case 0:
               return "First item";
          ...
     }
}
```
## How to customize?
I. In your `layout.xml` file you can set a few attributes to `RoundedTabLayout`:
* `android:background` 
    * This attribute works just like usual `background` attribute (reference to a color).
* `app:accent`
    * This attribute allows you to set accent color for tab selection, stroke and text (reference to a color).
* `app:cornerRadius`
    * This attribute sets the tab corner radius. Possible values are:
        * `circle` (default)
        * `rounded`
        * `rectangle`
        * value in px from `0` to `50`
        
II. In your `class.java` you can set some values to customize specific tab:
* Use `RoundTab#setIcon` method to change icon. You can get `RoundTab` object via `RoundTabLayout#getTab` method which accept tab index as parameter. To enable tab icon, you should also use `RoundTab#setHasIcon`.
```java
…
//after initializing RoundTabLayout and ViewPager
RoundTab tab = tabLayout.getTab(0);
Drawable icon = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.globe);
tab.setIcon(icon);
//enable icon in current tab
tab.setHasIcon(true);

//repeat this code for another tabs
…
```
* To disable tab stroke use `RoundTab#setHasStroke` method.
```java
…
//after initializing RoundTabLayout and ViewPager
RoundTab tab = tabLayout.getTab(0);
tab.setHasStroke(true);
…
```
* To change corners radius use `RoundTab#setCornerRadius` which accept values from `0` to `50` as a parameter.
```java
…
//after initializing RoundTabLayout and ViewPager
RoundTab tab = tabLayout.getTab(0);
tab.setCornerRadius(35);
…
```
* To change tab text use `RoundTab#setText` which accept `String` as a parameter.
```java
…
//after initializing RoundTabLayout and ViewPager
RoundTab tab = tabLayout.getTab(0);
tab.setText(“Usage example”);
…
```
## Where is un-material-tab demo app?
The `app` works just as an example of usage with different options. Will be uploaded to Play Store sooner.

## What about contributions?
This is my first public repo and first library so I’m trying to keep this code as much clean and well-commented as I can.
Feel free to contribute :)
